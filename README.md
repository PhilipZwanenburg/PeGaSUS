Petrov-Galerkin Solver for Unstructured Simulations

This project aims to provide a Finite Element implementation capable of simulating various partial
differential equations on geometrically complex domains using the Petrov-Galerkin method.

The discretization employs an adaptive T-spline approximation basis which allows for exact geometry
representation (as defined according to the reference CAD model) and is motivated by the
IsoGeometric Analysis paradigm.

\todo Add note about unit/integration tests for understanding segments of the code.
\todo Add supported PDEs
\todo Add list of software being used
